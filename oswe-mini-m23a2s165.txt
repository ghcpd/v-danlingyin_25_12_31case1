You are a senior developer advocate and software engineer.
Your task is to validate whether the examples and tutorials provided in the project documentation actually work as described.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Responsibilities
1.Identify example code in documentation
- Locate all code examples in README.md or docs/*.md
- Identify their intended usage and expected outcome
2.Validate against source code
- Compare example usage with actual function signatures
- Determine whether the example would:
- Compile
- Run successfully
- Produce the documented result
3.For each broken example, report:
- Documentation file
- Section
- Example code (as written)
- Failure reason
- Actual required usage (based on code)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.Classify severity
- High: Example cannot run at all
- Medium: Example runs but behaves incorrectly
- Low: Minor fix required
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Produce fixed examples Generate:
- README_backup.md
- README.md with corrected examples only
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.Generate example_validation.md Include:
- Why the original example fails
- How the corrected example aligns with code behavior
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Rules
- MUST NOT modify source code
- MUST base conclusions strictly on provided files
- MUST include runnable corrected examples

Summary
- Found 1 broken example in README.md (Quick Start). Severity: High — the example cannot run.
- Fixes applied to docs only (source code unchanged).
- Files created:
  - README_backup.md (original README)
  - README.md (corrected runnable examples)
  - example_validation.md (validation report)

What was wrong
- Original README used `new RetryClient({ retryCount: 0 })`.
- input.ts rejects retryCount < 1 (throws "retryCount must be between 1 and 5"), so the example fails at construction.

What I changed
- Replaced the invalid Quick Start example with runnable examples that:
  - Use the default retryCount (3) and show success after retries.
  - Show final failure when retries are exhausted.
- Created README_backup.md containing the original README.
- Added example_validation.md explaining the failure, severity, and corrected usage.

Files updated/added
- Modified: README.md (corrected examples)
- Added: README_backup.md
- Added: example_validation.md

Quick remediation (how to use correctly)
- Valid values for retryCount: 1..5 or omit to use default (3).
- Example (from updated README): create client with `new RetryClient()` or `new RetryClient({ retryCount: 2 })` and pass an async task to `run()`.

Would you like me to:
- Run the corrected examples here?
- Add a short note to README explaining valid retryCount range?

Made changes.
